## Overview

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, vast amounts of data regarding infection rates, vaccination progress, and more are now available. However, interpreting raw data in tables can be challenging and time-consuming. Data visualization provides an effective solution, allowing this information to be presented in a clear, visual format, making it easier to understand and utilize quickly.

This project is a data visualization web application that presents COVID-19 statistics for Thailand, including real-time infection and vaccination rates. Data is gathered from reliable sources through web scraping, then processed and presented in an interactive, easy-to-read format.

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: Created various charts and graphs to visualize COVID-19 infection rates and vaccination progress, providing users with a clear and intuitive view of pandemic trends in Thailand.
- **Real-time Data Fetching**: Developed web scraping solutions with Beautiful Soup to gather up-to-date COVID-19 statistics from trusted sources, ensuring that the data displayed is current and relevant.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Built a FastAPI backend to manage data processing and API endpoints, securely sending the scraped data to the frontend for real-time visualization.
- **React Frontend**: Designed a responsive, interactive frontend using React, enabling users to easily explore and interpret the COVID-19 data.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gathering reliable data from multiple sources and cleaning it for consistency was crucial to ensure accurate visualizations.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Ensuring the web scraper and API could handle real-time data updates without interrupting the user experience required careful handling of API calls and caching mechanisms.
- **Data Presentation**: Designing visualizations that effectively communicate data trends while remaining user-friendly required experimenting with various chart types and layouts.

## Outcome

The COVID-19 Data Visualization web app provides a user-friendly platform for tracking COVID-19 trends in Thailand. Through clear data visualizations, users can easily access the latest information on infection and vaccination rates, making it a valuable tool for understanding the pandemicâ€™s impact. This project also highlights the power of combining data scraping, backend processing, and frontend visualization to create a cohesive, informative application.
